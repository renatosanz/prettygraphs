  Every object in the game, except for Lua's default data types (number, string, table, etc), is an "object" instance.
  Every object has all engine functions injected to it via the mixin feature ("class_add" function in the class module).
  Thus, every object can do everything every other object can, with very few exceptions.
  This is a no-bureaucracy approach to makes games that works well for me, someone who enjoys borderless thought and action.

  There are two ways of creating objects. The first is by creating a class and then instantiating an object:
    player = class:class_new(object)
    function player:new(x, y, args)
      self:object('player', args)
      self.x, self.y = x, y
    end

    function player:update(dt)
      layer:circle(self.x, self.y, 8, an.colors.fg[0])
    end
  In this example, the "player:new" function is the player class' constructor, and the "player:update" function is the update function that gets called every frame.
  Objects can also be named, and in the example above "self:object('player', args)" names this object's .name attribute to 'player'.
  In general, if you're going to name an object, that name should be unique, because names get used to organize objects in parent/child relations so that they can be more easily referred to by names.

  The second way of creating objects is anonymously/locally:
    player = function(x, y, args)
      return object('player', args):build(function(self)
        self.x, self.y = x, y
      end):action(function(self, dt)
        layer:circle(self.x, self.y, 8, an.colors.fg[0])
      end)
    end
  This is a more convenient way of defining new types of objects because it can be contained in a single function.
  It is, however, more expensive, due to the usage of multiple closures. Although if you're using this engine as it is right now, performance shouldn't be your primary focus.
  (In the sense that the engine is poorly optimized and you should be making games with it that don't really need that much processing power).
  This second way uses functions "object:build" and "object:action", which function the same as "new" and "update" when defining a class the first way.
  An object may have multiple actions attached to it, and if an action returns true it will automatically be removed from the object at the end of the frame.

  The engine organizes objects into a tree that is processed in DFS order and ensures that each object is only updated once per frame.
  All actions attached to an object are also guaranteed to be called only once per frame.
  This tree is used for organizing object hierarchies and for ordering object updates, while drawing and draw ordering are left entirely to the layer module.
  The root of the tree is always the "an" object, and so every object must be added to it or to one its children to be updated, for instance:
    an:add(player(an.w/2, an.h/2))
  In this example, because the player object is named (its name is 'player'), when it is added to "an", several things happen:
    "an" object's .children attribute is inserted the player instance
    player object's .parents attributed is inserted "an"
    if played is named (it is), an.player now points to the player object
    if an is named (it is), player.an now points to the "an" object
  This means that, following the example above, if you want to get a reference to the player object all you have to do is say "an.player" or "an.children[1]".
  And if you want to get a reference to "an" from one of the player's functions all you have to do is say "self.an" or "self.parents[1]".
  Objects may have multiple parents and multiple children, may refer to each other in loops, and everything work fine and their update function and action functions will only be updated once.

  Objects may also be tagged. By default, whenever a mixin module is initialized, an object's .tags attribute for that mixin is set to true.
  For instance, initializing the self:timer() mixin on an object's constructor means that self.tags.timer is now true.
  However, the user may also use the "object:tag" function to explicitly tag an object with the user's own gameplay-related strings.
  This can then be checked using the "is" function:
    player = object():tag('friendly', 'controllable')
    print(player:is('friendly'))             -> true
    print(player:is('controllable'))         -> true
    print(player:is('enemy'))                -> false
    print(object():collider():is('collider') -> true

  As previously mentioned, the engine works with a tree structure. The root object is always "an", and objects must be added to it or to one of its children to be updated.
  The exact order of operations for the tree update process goes like this:
    1. Every frame, before anything else happens, all tree nodes are collected into a list in DFS order.
    2. an's early update action is run, because an is the first node on the tree, and because early update actions run first; this function is defined in anchor/init.lua.
       This is where layers get their draw commands reset, where audio is updated and where the physics world is updated.
    3. For each object, the _early_update function calls the object's "early_update" function if it exists, and then calls all early actions attached to that object.
    4. For each object, the _update function calls all mixins that need to be called, calls the object's "update" function if it exists, and then calls all actions attached to that object.
    5. For each object, the _late_update function calls all mixins to be called, calls the object's "late_update" function if it exists, and then calls all late actions attached to that object.
    6. For each object, the cleanup function removes all early actions, actions and late actions that need to be removed (if they returned true that frame).
    7. For each object, the remove_dead_branch function removes all objects under it if it is dead. This removal also unlinks parents/children and calls "destroy" on all dead branch objects.
  There are several important things to note about this setup. The first is that this is only used for organizing object update order.
  There is nothing about the tree that changes how or when objects are drawn, that's left entirely up to the layer module and the calls each object makes to it from its update function.
  Second, because objects are collected at step 1, any object that gets added in the next steps will not get updated this frame, since it's not in the list of nodes that were collected in that step.
  Third, when an object dies it also kills all objects under it, which means that care must be taken when creating objects to choose parents with similar lifetime behaviors.
  Fourth, this setup naturally adds more complexity to the engine and to gameplay code, but I deemed this complexity worth it since it solves multiple problems I've had for years at once.

  If you want to use this code, I'd highly recommend reading the code in this file as well as anchor/init.lua to understand everything that's happening clearly.
  I also recommend reading some of my codebases that are/will be made available on GitHub that use this setup to see what it looks like in action.

  Adds an object to the end of this object's list of children.
  This is the main way in which objects get updated, and for things to work you need to initially add objects to the tree's root node (an).
  Here are all the things that happen in this function:
    Self's .children table is added the child object.
    The added object's .parents table is added self.
    If the child object has a .name attribute and that name isn't in use by self's table, then that name on self will now point to the child object.
    If the parent object (self) has a .name attribute and that name isn't in use by the child's table, then that name on the child will now point to the parent object.
    If the name is already in use in either case, a warning message will be printed to the console and nothing will change when it comes to name references.
  Example:
    player = object('player_1')
    an:add(player) -> now an.children[1] and an.player_1 point to the player object, and player.parents[1] and player.an point to an
--]]
function object:add(...)
	for _, child in ipairs({ ... }) do
		table.insert(self.children, child)
		table.insert(child.parents, self)
		if child.name then
			if not self[child.name] then
				self[child.name] = child
			else
				print(child.name .. " is already indexed by self - " .. self:get_who_called_me())
			end
		end
		if self.name then
			if not child[self.name] then
				child[self.name] = self
			else
				print(self.name .. " is already indexed by child - " .. self:get_who_called_me())
			end
		end
	end
	return self
end

--[[
  Returns true if this object has the given name, or if it is of the given type.
  Examples:
    object'player':is'player'        -> true
    object'player':is'enemy'         -> false
    object():collider():is'collider' -> true, modules always set self.tags.module_name to true on initialization
--]]
function object:is(name_or_type)
	return self.name == name_or_type or self.tags[name_or_type]
end

--[[
  Tags this object with the given tags and returns self.
  This means self:is(tag) will return true for the passed in tags.
  This is useful when you need to identify or search for objects by some non-unique identifier that makes sense for your gameplay.
  Example:
    self:tag('projectile', 'enemy_projectile' -> now self.tags.projectile and self.tags.enemy_projectile are both true
--]]
function object:tag(...)
	for _, tag in ipairs({ ... }) do
		self.tags[tag] = true
	end
	return self
end

--[[
  Sets self.flashing to true for the given duration.
  This could be a function that changes any variable for a duration, but given how often flashing happens it was created for this purpose alone.
  Example:
    an:flash()     -> sets self.flashing to true for 0.1 seconds
    an:flash(0.15) -> sets self.flashing to true for 0.15 seconds
  To flash an object, as in make it flash white, you'd need to do this:
    game:draw(an.images.image, self.x, self.y, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, an.colors.white[0], self.flashing and an.shaders.combine) -- TODO: revise this, will be different with cf most likely
  Which uses the "combine" shader with a white color to make the object turn white and thus flash as long as self.flashing is true.

function object:flash(duration)
	if not self.tags.timer then
		error("object must be initialized as a timer for the flash function to work")
	end
	self.flashing = true
	self:timer_after(duration or 0.15, function()
		self.flashing = false
	end, "flashing")
end

--[[
  Returns the amount of time left for the current flash set by object:flash.
  Example:
    an:flash(0.15)           -> sets self.flashing to true for 0.1 seconds
    an:get_flash_time_left() -> if called after 0.05 seconds from when an:flash was called, this will return 0.1
--]]
function object:get_flash_time_left()
	return self:timer_get_time_left("flashing")
end

--[[
  Slows the object by changing self.slow_amount to some value below 1 and then tweening it up to 1 again.
  The delta value passed to an object's function automatically gets multiplied by this value.
  Importantly, the object must be initialized as a timer otherwise the function will not work.
  Calling "an:slow" will slow all of an's children, and thus all objects in the game.
  Examples:
    an:slow(0, 0)                -> stops the simulation for 1 frame, since on the next it ends and sets self.slow_amount to 1
    an:slow(1, 1)                -> does nothing
    an:slow(0.5, 0.5)            -> slows down to 0.5 for 0.5s using the math.cubic_in_out easing method
    an:slow(0.2, 1, math.linear) -> slows down to 0.2 for 1s using the math.linear easing method
]]
--
function object:slow(slow_amount, duration, tween_method)
	if not self.tags.timer then
		error("object must be initialized as a timer for the slow function to work")
	end
	local slow_amount = slow_amount or 0.5
	self.slow_amount = slow_amount
	self:timer_tween(duration or 0.5, self, { slow_amount = 1 }, tween_method or math.cubic_in_out, function()
		self.slow_amount = 1

--[[
  Returns a unique id.
  This just increments object's .id attribute and returns that value.
]]
--
function object:uid()
	object.id = object.id + 1
	return object.id
end

--[[
  Returns a string that reports which function called the current function we're in.
  This uses debug.getinfo to get that information, so it works exactly as that does, it just formats the information out nicely.
--]]
function object:get_who_called_me()
	local info = debug.getinfo(3, "Sl")
	return info.short_src .. "@" .. info.currentline
